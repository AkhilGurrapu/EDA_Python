# Exploratory Data Analysis With Python and Pandas

## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring a sales dataset from a supermarket retail chain and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and Pandas. Here's a summary of what I have covered:

- Initial data exploration using Pandas.
- Univariate analysis of continuous and categorical variables.
- Bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables.
- Handling duplicate rows and missing values.
- Conducting correlation analysis.
